# Capstone project for the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate

Please note, this project barely represents what real, complex, projects look like. It's based on outdated `create-react-app` and `react-scripts` versions, and it's not meant to be a reference for best practices. It's just a simple project to validate the certification.
This kind of project does not benefit from react's ecosystem and capabilities, you're actually shooting yourself in the foot by using this approach. Small, static, projects are better off with plain HTML, CSS, and JS, or a SSG like Astro, Eleventy, or Gatsby (I'd personally avoid gatsby tho).
